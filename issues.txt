Known issues:
1. Save location is not used when "Attach Debug Info" is checked. In this case output files are
always put in the same directory as the loaded IDA database.

2. When "Attach Debug Info" is used with a file which already has DWARF info present, the output
file is written with merged- and corrupted DWARF info.

3. The tool generates incorrect DWARF addresses when the IDA file has been relocated (typically by
the IDA debugger). The DWARF addresses become inconsistent with the ELF section addresses. This
leads to LLDB rejecting function name lookups, since it can not verify that an address is present
inside an executable section. See SymbolFileDWARF::ResolveFunction in the LLDB source code.

4. Functions manually named in IDA with "::" qualifiers can not be looked up in LLDB. This is due
to inconsistent names stored in DWARF for this special case. For example, the name "Class::Method"
is stored with DW_AT_name "Class__Method" and DW_AT_linkage_name "Class::Method". LLDB lookup
fails for both names. The first actually finds the symbol internally but thereafter discards it
due to a requirement that the name is a substring of the linkage name. See the source code for
Module::LookupInfo::LookupInfo and Module::LookupInfo::Prune in LLDB.
